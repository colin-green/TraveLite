Project title: TravelLite

Project members: Farangiz Asadulla, Andrew Fowose, Colin Green, Isimemen Inegbedion

Description: A website where users can plan their next vacation. They enter in a place they would like to visit, as well as their origin city, and are returned cheapest flight prices, images, upcoming weather, and possibly even recent tweets about their destination.

Sketch Design: A single HTML web page. Our logo/title near the top, maybe a picture background. To the lower left, there will be an input query where the user can input their origin and destination cities. Then, to the right of that, an area will be populated with flight price(s), image(s), weather that matches their flight dates, and possibly recent tweets regarding the destination.
